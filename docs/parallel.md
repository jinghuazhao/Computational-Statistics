# Parallel computing

Recent notes are available from <https://cambridge-ceu.github.io/csd3/systems/ParallelComputing.html>.

## GNU parallel

It has home <https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/> -- note especially with its --env to pass environment variables.

Under Ubuntu, GNU parallel is easily installed as follows,
```{bash}
sudo apt install parallel
```
Earlier version had issues with temporary direvtory, e.g., <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24398941/gnu-parallel-unlink-error>
if 
```bash
module load parallel/20131222
```
The latest, <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parallel/parallel-latest.tar.bz2>, can be used instead.

## SGE

Sun Grid Engine has a [wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine).

<https://peteris.rocks/blog/sun-grid-engine-installation-on-ubuntu-server/>.

To delete SGE jobs shown in qstat, use 
```bash
qstat | grep $USER | cut -d" " -f1 | xargs qdel
```
Otherwise for a consecutive sequence we use qdel {id1..id2}.

## SLURM

Under Ubuntu, it can be installed with
```bash
sudo apt install slurm-client
```

General information is available from <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>.

command | description
--------|-------------
sacct 	| report job accounting information about active or completed jobs
salloc 	| allocate resources for a job in real time (typically used to allocate resources and spawn a shell, in which the srun command is used to launch parallel tasks)
sbatch 	| submit a job script for later execution (the script typically contains one or more srun commands to launch parallel tasks)
scancel | cancel a pending or running job
scontrol| hold, holdu, release, requeue, requeuehold, suspend and resume commands
sinfo 	| reports the state of partitions and nodes managed by Slurm (it has a variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options)
squeue 	| reports the state of jobs (it has a variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options), by default, reports the running jobs in priority order followed by the pending jobs in priority order
srun 	| used to submit a job for execution in real time

e.g., squeue -u $USER -r; qstat -u $USER; also scontrol show config; scontrol show partition; scontrol show job [jobid] and sview

To see environmental variables, e.g., MaxArraySize, we use
```bash
scontrol show config | sed -n '/^MaxArraySize/s/.*= *//p'
```

* temporary directories, <https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Temporary_Directories>

> When a SLURM job starts, the scheduler creates a temporary directory for the job on the compute node's local hard drive. This $SLURM_TMPDIR directory is very useful for jobs that need to use or generate a large number of small files, as the /ufrc parallel filesystem is optimized for large file streaming and is less suitable for small files.

> The directory is owned by the user running the job. The path to the temporary directory is made available as the $SLURM_TMPDIR variable. At the end of the job, the temporary directory is automatically removed.

> You can use the ${SLURM_TMPDIR} variable in job scripts to copy temporary data to the temporary job directory. If necessary, it can also be used as argument for applications that accept a temporary directory argument.

> Many applications and programming languages use the $TMPDIR environment variable, if available, as the default temporary directory path. If this variable is not set, the applications will default to using the /tmp directory, which is not desirable. SLURM will set $TMPDIR to the same value as $SLURM_TMPDIR unless $TMPDIR has already been set, in which case it will be ignored. Check your job script(s) and shell initialization files like .bashrc and .bash_profile to make sure you do not have $TMPDIR set.

> If a personal Singularity container is used, make sure that the $SINGULARITYENV_TMPDIR variable is set within the job to export the local scratch location into the Singularity container. 

Examples of an interactive session can be simply `sintr`, or
```bash
srun -N1 -n1 -c6 -p short,medium,long -t 12:0:0 --pty bash -i
```
so that the earliest available partition will be used.

## SGE to SLURM

Conversion is documented at <https://srcc.stanford.edu/sge-slurm-conversion>.

## EXAMPLES

We intended to convert a large number of PDF files (INTERVAL.*.manhattn.pdf) to PNG with smaller file sizes. To start, we build a file list,

```bash
ls *pdf | \
sed 's/INTERVAL.//g;s/.manhattan.pdf//g' > INTERVAL.list
```
We do this with GNU parallel as follows,
```bash
cat INTERVAL.list | \
parallel -C' ' '
  echo {}
  pdftopng -r 300 INTERVAL.{}.manhattan.pdf
  mv {}-000001.png INTERVAL.{}.png
'
```
or with SLURM,
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --job-name=pdftopng
#SBATCH --time=6:00:00
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --partition=short
#SBATCH --array=1-50
#SBATCH --output=work/pdftopng_%A_%a.out
#SBATCH --error=work/pdftopng_%A_%a.err
#SBATCH --export ALL

. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load default-cardio
module load slurm
module load use.own

export p=$(awk 'NR==ENVIRON["SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"]' INTERVAL.list)
export TMPDIR=/scratch/jhz22/tmp

echo ${p}
pdftopng -r 300 INTERVAL.${p}.manhattan.pdf ${p}
mv ${p}-000001.png INTERVAL.${p}.png

```
This is a single parameter case and it is possible to allow for more parameters in both cases.

Note also that the option `--array=1-50` instructs the system to schedule jobs and in jobs with large memory usage it is more preferable to change to `--array 1-50%4` so that a maximum of four jobs will be run simultaneously.
