# Flask

Considerable coverage has been given on Flask, e.g., <https://cambridge-ceu.github.io/GitHub-matters/Flask/>, and WSGI is touched upon here, <https://cambridge-ceu.github.io/CEU-matters/Flask/>.

As ususal, this is furnished with [`app.py`](app.py) and [`config.py`](config.py) with [`templates`](templates) in its simplest form.

```
Flask/
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── README.md (this file)
└── templates
    └── index.html
```

which uses environment variable from `export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(grep sk ~/doc/OpenAI)`.

By default, `python app.py` will enable `http://127.0.0.1:5000`:

```
$ python app.py
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
